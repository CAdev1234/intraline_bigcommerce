        title: "Are the M Plus Series Dermal Fillers monophasic or biphasic?",
        detail: "The M Plus Series are monophasic dermal fillers with lidocaine. "
    },
    {
        title: "What is the difference between a monophasic dermal filler and a biphasic dermal filler?",
        detail: "HA fillers can be classified according to their particulate forms: either monophasic or biphasic gels. Monophasic gels consist of a single ‘phase’ of HA. They can be either monodensified, HA is mixed and cross-linked in a single step e.g. M Series of Juvederm, or polydensified, HA goes through two stages of cross-linking e.g. Belotero. Biphasic gels such as Intraline One, Two, and For Men or Restylane consist of two ‘phases’ of HA, cross-linked HA of a specific size which is then suspended in non-  cross-linked HA acting as a carrier.20,21. There is much debate over the clinical effectiveness of monophasic or biphasic hyaluronic acid                      fillers and it is likely that no single method is superior to another, rather that the different physical properties of dermal fillers are more suitable for different clinical indications."

    {
        title: "What are potential side effects with Intraline M Plus Series of Dermal Fillers?",
        detail: "With any cosmetic procedure there is a range of potential side effects. The most common side effects include temporary reactions at the treatment site such as tenderness, swelling, firmness, lumps/bumps, bruising, pain, redness, discoloration, and itching. The reactions normally appear shortly after treatment and may last up to 7 days for injections into the skin and up to 14 for injection into the lips. In rare cases severe discomfort is experienced and can give rise to other conditions, such as oedema or prolonged swelling. In this instance we recommend immediate treatment of the patient. Although most side effects will resolve with time, some side effects may persist longer than 30 days. You may choose to treat your patient with medications, such as antibiotics, steroids, or hyaluronidase (an enzyme that breaks down HA and essentially removes the product). The risks associated with dermal fillers are low, but it is important to be aware and communicate these risks to your patient prior to treatment."
